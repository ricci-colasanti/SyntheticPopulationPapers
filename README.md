## Creating Realistic Synthetic Populations at Varying Spatial Scales  2012 
Comparative Critique of Population Synthesis Techniques
The text discusses various methodologies for generating synthetic populations, including deterministic reweighting, conditional probability (Monte Carlo simulation), and simulated annealing. Each method has its limitations, such as the geographical scale it can be applied to or the number of real population characteristics it can replicate. The research evaluates the performance of these methods across different spatial scales and finds that the simulated annealing algorithm produces the most consistent and accurate synthetic populations across all scales. The relative strengths and weaknesses of each method are further discussed.


## Microsimulation Nik Lomax 2016
Realistic Synthetic Populations_published.pdf).
This chapter offers an overview of microsimulation techniques used to estimate the distribution and evolution of phenomena over time and across different population groups. The discussion is divided into three main research areas:

1. **Generation of Synthetic Population Data**: This involves creating detailed, attribute-rich individual-level population data. These data are used to assess distributional differences or as inputs for other models.

2. **Static Models**: These models evaluate short-term changes in a system, such as the immediate effects of policy changes on the distribution of outcomes.

3. **Dynamic Models**: These models incorporate time to assess the long-term impacts of changes on individuals as they transition through a system of interest.

When individuals in these models have geographical identifiers, the methods are often referred to as spatial microsimulation, allowing for comparisons across different areas.


## Generation of Synthetic Populations in Social Simulations: A Review of Methods and Practices 2022
The paper reviews advanced methodologies and theories for creating realistic synthetic populations for agent-based simulation models, focusing on social simulations. It emphasizes the importance of data on social agents' attributes, which are crucial for model outcomes but often challenging to collect and integrate into simulations. The review identifies discrepancies between theoretical approaches and practical applications in the field. By analyzing work published in the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation (JASSS) from 2011 to 2021, the paper highlights the challenges in bridging the gap between theory and practice. It concludes with several recommendations to help modelers adopt best practices for generating synthetic populations


## Survey on Synthetic Data Generation, Evaluation Methodsand GANs 2022
The abstract presents a survey that combines the topics of synthetic data generation and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), aiming to serve as a comprehensive starting point for new researchers in the field. The survey reviews state-of-the-art methods by analyzing data from four major databases: Web of Sciences (WoS), Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library. Key insights include identifying relevant authors, journals, cited papers, research areas, institutions, and GAN architectures. The review covers common training problems, significant breakthroughs, and GAN architectures for tabular data. It also discusses algorithms for generating synthetic data, their applications, and methods for evaluating the quality of synthetic data, with a focus on tabular data. The survey provides a schematic overview of the presented information to offer a clear and structured understanding of the field.
